Hello Internet

I have decided to actually start a blog. I have been putting this off for much too long.
I keep finding reasons not to, but perhaps someone else will find some of this information useful.

Blogs are a great way to share ideas in an open environment, without fear of restrictions from third-party
services. They give content-creators the most freedom and flexibility in how content is distributed.

Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks that act as a "[walled garden][walled-garden]" can moderate
content that is unfavorable or promote content for a price.

This is sometimes a necessary evil in the case of [terrorist activities][twitter-terror] but has been a issue
with [Facebook moderating conservative news outlets][facebook-suppression]. This makes sense when put
in the perspective of capitalism. These social media outlets exist to turn a profit, not to provide a
social good. Millions of people willingly give their information in exchange for services that
make communication easier and more convenient. While appealing to many, this has some unintended consequences
such as no ability to remove data, only the ability to "hide" it (depending on the service), or an
old Facebook post turning up on a background check.

Blogs give authors the freedom to share and exchange ideas and information in a way that promotes freedom and
equality. With the many (and growing) number of options creating one is extremely fast and easy. All it takes
is a Internet connection and an idea.

That's why I'm starting this blog.
